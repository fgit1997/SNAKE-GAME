The Project is a Snake game made in Rust Language.Rust is a multi-paradigm, high-level, general-purpose programming language that emphasizes performance, type safety and concurrency. It enforces memory safety—that is, that all references point to valid memory—without requiring the use of a garbage collector or reference counting present in other memory-safe languages.
